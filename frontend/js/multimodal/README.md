# Multimodal Input Processing

This directory handles various forms of user input beyond traditional keyboard/mouse,
including gestures, voice, and potentially other biometric data.

## TODO
- Create dedicated modules for voice input processing (e.g., speech-to-text client).
- Design a system for fusing data from multiple modalities.
- Integrate with Tria bots for interpreting multimodal commands.
