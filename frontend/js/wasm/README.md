# WebAssembly Modules

This directory contains WebAssembly (WASM) modules and their source code (e.g., Rust, C++)
for performance-critical tasks like advanced audio analysis, physics, or cryptography.

-   `/src`: Contains the source code for WASM modules (e.g., Rust crates, C++ projects).
-   JavaScript files in this directory will handle loading and interfacing with the compiled WASM modules.

## Build Process (Conceptual)
- Rust: `wasm-pack build --target web` in the respective Rust project directory.
- C++: Emscripten (`emcc`) to compile to WASM/JS.

## TODO
- Set up build toolchains for Rust-to-WASM and C++-to-WASM.
- Implement JavaScript bindings for each WASM module.
- Develop examples of using WASM modules for audio processing, etc.
