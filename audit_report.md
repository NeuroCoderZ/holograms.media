---

### A. User Authentication (Firebase Auth + PostgreSQL Sync)

*   **Overall Status:** Partially Implemented / In Progress.
*   **Files to Modify/Create:**
    *   `frontend/js/core/auth.js`: **Exists.** Needs review to ensure Firebase Web SDK integration is complete and JWT is sent to `auth_sync` cloud function.
    *   `backend/cloud_functions/auth_sync/main.py`: **Exists.** Needs review of JWT handling, `auth_service.py` usage, and `crud_operations.py` integration.
    *   `backend/core/auth_service.py`: **Likely Exists as `backend/services/AuthService.py`.** Needs refactoring and confirmation of JWT decoding and user data extraction logic. Path: `backend/services/AuthService.py`.
    *   `backend/core/crud_operations.py`: **Exists.** Path: `backend/core/crud_operations.py`. Needs review to ensure it's callable by Cloud Functions and handles user creation/checking.
    *   `backend/core/models/user_models.py`: **Exists.** Path: `backend/core/models/user_models.py`. Needs review for Pydantic models alignment with `auth_sync` requirements.
    *   `backend/core/db/schemas.sql`: **Exists.** Path: `backend/core/db/schema.sql` (Note: document lists `schemas.sql` but actual file is `schema.sql`). Needs review of `users` table schema. `tria_learning_log` and `user_chat_sessions` tables are missing from this schema file.
*   **Key Challenges/Considerations:** Secure JWT handling, Cloud Function cold starts, Neon.tech "no credit card" policy verification.

### B. Frontend - Core Hologram Visualization & Audio Reactivity

*   **Overall Status:** Partially Implemented.
*   **Files to Modify/Create:**
    *   `frontend/js/3d/hologramRenderer.js`, `frontend/js/3d/sceneSetup.js`, `frontend/js/audio/audioAnalyzer.js`, `frontend/js/config/hologramConfig.js`, `frontend/js/main.js`, `frontend/index.html`: All **Exist.**
    *   `frontend/js/audio/audioVisualizer.js`: **File Not Found.** Likely `frontend/js/audio/visualization.js`. Needs confirmation.
*   **Key Challenges/Considerations:** Integration of PR #40 concepts, performance, cross-browser compatibility. Logic for audio-visual mapping **Needs Review.**

---

### C. Frontend - UI for MVP (Buttons, Panels, Basic Interactions)

*   **Overall Status:** Partially Implemented.
*   **Files to Modify/Create:**
    *   `frontend/index.html`, `frontend/style.css`, `frontend/js/ui/uiManager.js`, `frontend/js/ui/panelManager.js`, `frontend/js/main.js`: All **Exist.**
    *   `frontend/js/ui/chatUI.js`: **File Not Found.** Alternatives like `frontend/js/panels/chatMessages.js` or `frontend/panels/chat_panel.js` need clarification for chat UI handling.
*   **Key Challenges/Considerations:** Comprehensive review of all button event listeners in `uiManager.js` is needed. Chat input/send functionality verification.

---

### D. "Interaction Chunk" Pipeline (Frontend to Firebase Storage to Cloud Function)

*   **Overall Status:** Partially Implemented.
*   **Files to Modify/Create:**
    *   `frontend/js/services/firebaseStorageService.js`, `backend/cloud_functions/process_chunk/main.py`, `backend/core/crud_operations.py`, `backend/core/models/multimodal_models.py`, `backend/core/db/schema.sql` (actual: `schema.sql`): All **Exist.**
*   **Key Challenges/Considerations:** Firebase Storage trigger configuration, Cloud Function permissions, error handling in `process_chunk/main.py`. `audiovisual_gestural_chunks` schema exists.

---

### E. Backend - Core Logic in Firebase Cloud Functions (Python)

*   **Overall Status:** Partially Implemented.
*   **Files to Modify/Create:**
    *   `backend/cloud_functions/` (with subdirs for `auth_sync`, `process_chunk`, `tria_chat_handler`): **Exists.**
    *   `backend/main.py`: **Exists.** Role with Cloud Functions (FastAPI app vs. individual deployment) needs clarification.
    *   `backend/core/db/pg_connector.py`, `backend/core/crud_operations.py`, `backend/core/services/llm_service.py`, `backend/core/tria_bots/ChatBot.py`: All **Exist.**
    *   `backend/core/tria_bots/ChunkProcessorBot.py`: **Not Found.** Action required.
    *   Firebase Functions configuration for env variables: External, needs verification.
*   **Key Challenges/Considerations:** Function granularity, cold starts, execution time limits, dependency management (global vs. per-function `requirements.txt`), local testing, secure connection to Neon.tech.

---

### F. Backend - MVP Tria Bot Logic (Python modules in `backend/core/tria_bots/`)

*   **Overall Status:** Partially Implemented.
*   **Files to Modify/Create:**
    *   `backend/core/tria_bots/ChatBot.py`: **Exists.**
    *   `backend/core/tria_bots/ChunkProcessorBot.py`: **Not Found.** Action required.
    *   `backend/core/services/llm_service.py`: **Exists.**
    *   Cloud Function files (`tria_chat_handler/main.py`, `process_chunk/main.py`): **Exist.** Need review for bot module usage.
*   **Key Challenges/Considerations:** LLM API access (free tier, no card), LLM latency, bot logic structure. Logging to `tria_learning_log` (schema missing).

---

### G. Backend-Frontend Communication (HTTP for Cloud Functions)

*   **Overall Status:** Partially Implemented / Needs Verification.
*   **Files to Modify/Create:**
    *   `frontend/js/services/apiService.js`: **Exists.** Needs review of Cloud Function URL integration.
    *   WebSocket files: Confirmed deferred.
*   **Key Challenges/Considerations:** Management of Cloud Function URLs, consistent request/response formats.

---

### III. Timeline & Prioritization for June 9th (Firebase Focused) - Audit Summary

*   **Overall Assessment:** The project appears **at significant risk of delay** concerning the 10-day timeline.
*   **Key Blockers/Behind Schedule:**
    *   DB schemas: `tria_learning_log` and `user_chat_sessions` **missing** from `backend/core/db/schema.sql`. (Phase 1)
    *   `ChunkProcessorBot.py`: **Not Found.** (Phase 2)
    *   LLM API Key Confirmation: **Pending External Verification.** (Phase 2)
    *   Tasks dependent on the above (e.g., Tria interaction logging, full chunk processing) are blocked or cannot be completed.
*   **General Status:** Most other components are "Partially Implemented" or "In Progress," but require significant review, verification, and integration work. Frontend visualization (Phase 3) is in early stages, which is acceptable if foundational backend work (Phases 1-2) was complete, but it's not.
*   **Recommendation:** Immediate focus on resolving blockers (DB schemas, `ChunkProcessorBot.py`, LLM keys). Re-evaluate timeline once these are addressed.

### IV. Final Check & Polish (Internal Audit by Jules - Firebase Focus) - Audit

This section simulates the final check based on current audit findings.

*   **[ ] Constraint Compliance:**
    *   [X] **Neon.tech PostgreSQL** used (verified no card required for free tier, pgvector assumed included & functional).
        *   *Audit Finding:* `backend/core/db/pg_connector.py` exists. Neon.tech policy confirmed by document. pgvector functionality is an assumption.
    *   [X] Backend logic exclusively via **Firebase Cloud Functions (Python)**. Verified no credit card was required for deployment/operation within free tier limits.
        *   *Audit Finding:* Cloud Functions structure (`backend/cloud_functions/`) exists. Document confirms Firebase choice due to no-card constraint. Actual billing status of GCP project is an external check, assumed met per document.
    *   [X] **Firebase Auth & Storage** used (verified no card needed for free tiers).
        *   *Audit Finding:* Relevant SDKs/services are integrated (`frontend/js/core/auth.js`, `frontend/js/services/firebaseStorageService.js`). Document confirms no-card constraint.
    *   [?] Tria Bot LLM calls use Mistral/Devstral/Gemini with API keys not requiring a credit card for free/dev usage.
        *   *Audit Finding:* `llm_service.py` exists. **External verification of API key (no card, free tier) is PENDING.** (Marked as '?')
    *   [X] No other services requiring credit card for free tier are used.
        *   *Audit Finding:* Based on the document's explicit strategy, this is assumed true. No other services identified in the audit.

*   **[ ] Core Functionality Test (All on Firebase):**
    *   [?] User can sign up and log in via Firebase Auth.
        *   *Audit Finding:* `frontend/js/core/auth.js` and `backend/cloud_functions/auth_sync/main.py` exist. **Full E2E flow NEEDS VERIFICATION & TESTING.**
    *   [?] User data (UID, email) synced to Neon.tech PostgreSQL via `auth_sync` (or equivalent) Cloud Function.
        *   *Audit Finding:* See above. `crud_operations.py` and `user_models.py` exist. **Full E_E flow NEEDS VERIFICATION & TESTING.**
    *   [?] User can upload a small audio/video chunk to Firebase Storage.
        *   *Audit Finding:* `frontend/js/services/firebaseStorageService.js` exists. **NEEDS VERIFICATION & TESTING.**
    *   [?] `process_chunk` Cloud Function (Storage triggered) saves chunk metadata to Neon.tech PostgreSQL.
        *   *Audit Finding:* `backend/cloud_functions/process_chunk/main.py` exists. `audiovisual_gestural_chunks` schema exists. **NEEDS VERIFICATION & TESTING.** Integration with missing `ChunkProcessorBot.py` is an issue.
    *   [?] Basic Tria bot (via `tria_chat_handler` Cloud Function) provides an LLM-generated acknowledgment/response visible in UI.
        *   *Audit Finding:* `ChatBot.py`, `llm_service.py`, `tria_chat_handler/main.py` exist. `chatUI.js` is uncertain. **NEEDS VERIFICATION & TESTING.** Depends on LLM key confirmation and `tria_learning_log` schema for logging.
    *   [?] Hologram visualization (basic shape) is displayed on Firebase Hosting.
        *   *Audit Finding:* `hologramRenderer.js` exists. Firebase Hosting setup is external. **NEEDS VERIFICATION & TESTING.**
    *   [?] Hologram reacts to microphone input.
        *   *Audit Finding:* `audioAnalyzer.js`, `visualization.js` (assumed), `hologramConfig.js` exist. **Full integration and functionality NEEDS VERIFICATION & TESTING.** (File mismatch for `audioVisualizer.js`).
    *   [?] All MVP-critical UI buttons (as per `SYSTEM_INSTRUCTION_CURRENT.md`) are clickable and trigger appropriate actions (e.g., calls to Cloud Functions, UI changes).
        *   *Audit Finding:* `uiManager.js` exists. **NEEDS COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW & TESTING.**

*   **[ ] Technical Checks (Firebase Specific):**
    *   [?] Frontend deployed and accessible via Firebase Hosting URL.
        *   *Audit Finding:* External. **PENDING DEPLOYMENT & TESTING.**
    *   [?] All required Firebase Cloud Functions are deployed and operational (check logs in Firebase Console / Google Cloud Logging).
        *   *Audit Finding:* External. **PENDING DEPLOYMENT & TESTING.** Individual function code needs review.
    *   [?] HTTP Triggers for Cloud Functions are correctly configured and callable from frontend. Storage Triggers are operational.
        *   *Audit Finding:* External configuration. `apiService.js` needs URL review. **PENDING DEPLOYMENT & TESTING.**
    *   [?] Environment variables for Cloud Functions (DB connection string, LLM API keys) are correctly configured using `firebase functions:config:set` and accessible by functions.
        *   *Audit Finding:* External configuration. **PENDING VERIFICATION.**
    *   [?] Basic error handling and logging are present in Cloud Functions.
        *   *Audit Finding:* **NEEDS REVIEW** in each function's `main.py`.
    *   [?] Code (frontend, `backend/core/`, `backend/cloud_functions/` or `backend/main.py`) is reasonably commented.
        *   *Audit Finding:* **General code review needed.** Cannot confirm without deeper inspection.
    *   [?] Firebase Security Rules for Storage (and Firestore, if used) are configured for basic MVP security (e.g., authenticated users can write to their own paths).
        *   *Audit Finding:* External configuration (e.g. `firebase.json` or console). **PENDING VERIFICATION.**

*   **[ ] Documentation:**
    *   [?] `README.md` has clear instructions for Firebase project setup, local emulation (`firebase emulators:start`), frontend deployment (`firebase deploy --only hosting`), and Cloud Function deployment (`firebase deploy --only functions`).
        *   *Audit Finding:* `README.md` exists. Content **NEEDS REVIEW** for these specific instructions.
    *   [?] Key environment variables for Cloud Functions are documented (e.g., in `.env.example` or a separate config note).
        *   *Audit Finding:* `.env.example` exists. Content **NEEDS REVIEW** for completeness.

*   **[ ] MVP Scope Adherence:**
    *   [X] Features are within the defined MVP scope as per `ULTIMATE_ROAD_TO_MVP_JUNE_9.md`. No scope creep.
        *   *Audit Finding:* Based on the audit of sections A-G, the work seems aligned with the document's scope.
    *   [?] Complexity is managed; "keep it simple" principle applied, especially for Cloud Function logic and Tria MVP features.
        *   *Audit Finding:* **General code review needed.** Cloud function logic seems to rely on distinct bots, which is good. Missing `ChunkProcessorBot.py` and incomplete schemas are current complexity issues.

**Summary of Section IV Audit:**
Many items are marked with '[?]' (Needs Verification/Testing/Review) because they depend on:
1.  **External Verifications:** LLM keys, Firebase billing status, deployment status.
2.  **End-to-End Testing:** Most core functionalities require testing the integrated system.
3.  **Code Reviews:** For error handling, comments, specific logic details.
4.  **Addressing Missing Components/Information:** `ChunkProcessorBot.py`, DB schemas, clarification on `chatUI.js` and `audioVisualizer.js`.

The checklist highlights that while many individual files and components exist, the system's overall completeness and readiness for MVP are far from confirmed. The "Constraint Compliance" seems mostly on track, pending LLM key verification. "Core Functionality" is largely untested. "Technical Checks" and "Documentation" have many pending items.

---
**Overall Audit Conclusion:**
The project has a foundational structure with many components existing as per the `ULTIMATE_ROAD_TO_MVP_JUNE_9.md`. However, critical gaps (missing schemas, a core bot module), pending external verifications (LLM keys), and the need for extensive integration, review, and testing across almost all sections indicate that the MVP is **not currently complete** and the **June 9th timeline is highly optimistic / at severe risk.**

**Priority Actions Recommended:**
1.  **Address Blockers:**
    *   Add `tria_learning_log` and `user_chat_sessions` to `backend/core/db/schema.sql`.
    *   Create/locate and implement `backend/core/tria_bots/ChunkProcessorBot.py`.
    *   Urgently confirm LLM API key status (free tier, no card).
2.  **Clarify File Discrepancies:** Resolve naming for `audioVisualizer.js` and `chatUI.js`.
3.  **Verify Cloud Function Strategy:** Clarify role of `backend/main.py` and dependency management for Cloud Functions.
4.  **Systematic Review & Testing:** Begin focused integration testing for implemented parts of core flows (Auth, Chunk Upload, Basic Chat).
5.  **Re-evaluate Timeline:** Once blockers are resolved, reassess the timeline realistically.

This concludes the audit based on the provided document and file listing.
