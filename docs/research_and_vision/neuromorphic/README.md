# Neuromorphic Computing Research

This directory explores the potential of neuromorphic computing hardware
(e.g., Intel Loihi, SpiNNaker) for tasks within the Holographic Media project,
such as ultra-low power AI processing for Tria bots or efficient sensory data analysis.

## TODO
- Research current neuromorphic hardware platforms and their software stacks.
- Identify project tasks that could benefit most from neuromorphic approaches (e.g., real-time gesture recognition, audio pattern matching).
- Develop or adapt Spiking Neural Network (SNN) models for these tasks.
- Explore simulation environments for SNNs before deploying to hardware (if accessible).
