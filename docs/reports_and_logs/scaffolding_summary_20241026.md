# Report on Implemented Scaffolding (Commit: feat/future-scaffolding-research)

This report details the specific scaffolding elements implemented as part of the "Visionary Architecture & Foundational Scaffolding" task. These changes were introduced to lay groundwork for future development concepts.

## 1. Database Schema (`backend/db/schema.sql`)

The following placeholder tables were added. They are currently commented out in `schema.sql` to prevent execution on existing databases without a proper migration strategy.

*   **`tria_code_embeddings`**:
    *   **Purpose:** To store semantic vector embeddings of code components (functions, modules) for the "Liquid Code" concept.
*   **`tria_azr_tasks`**:
    *   **Purpose:** To manage tasks that Tria generates for itself as part of its Absolute Zero Reasoning (AZR) loop for self-evolution.
*   **`tria_azr_task_solutions`**:
    *   **Purpose:** To store the outcomes, artifacts, and performance metrics of Tria's attempts to solve AZR tasks.
*   **`tria_learning_log`**:
    *   **Purpose:** To maintain a log of significant learning events, parameter adjustments, and self-modification activities performed by Tria.
*   **`tria_bot_configurations`**:
    *   **Purpose:** To store versioned configurations for Tria's bots, allowing `LearningBot` to potentially update them as part of Tria's self-evolution.

## 2. Backend Models (`backend/models/`)

New Pydantic models were introduced in the following files:

*   **`backend/models/internal_bus_models.py`**:
    *   **`InternalMessage`**:
        *   **Purpose:** Provides a standardized model for messages exchanged between Tria's internal services and bots, decoupling internal communication from external wire formats like NetHoloGlyph.
*   **`backend/models/hologlyph_models.py`**:
    *   **`Vector3`**, **`Quaternion`**:
        *   **Purpose:** Basic geometric types mirroring structures from `nethologlyph/protocol/definitions.proto` for use in holographic representations.
    *   **`ThreeDEmojiModel`**:
        *   **Purpose:** A Pydantic model mirroring the `ThreeDEmoji` Protobuf message, representing a simple 3D object for holographic scenes.
    *   **`HolographicSymbolModel`**:
        *   **Purpose:** A placeholder Pydantic model to correspond with the `HolographicSymbol` Protobuf message, intended for richer, dynamic holographic content.

These new models were also added to the `__all__` list in `backend/models/__init__.py` for proper package integration.

## 3. Tria Bots (`backend/tria_bots/`)

Modifications were made to the following bot files to include placeholders for future capabilities:

*   **`backend/tria_bots/LearningBot.py`**:
    *   **`introspect_bot_state(self, bot_id: str) -> dict`**: Placeholder method for `LearningBot` to fetch the current state/parameters of another bot.
    *   **`get_bot_performance_metrics(self, bot_id: str, task_context: Optional[dict] = None) -> dict`**: Placeholder method for `LearningBot` to retrieve performance metrics from another bot.
    *   **`propose_bot_parameter_update(self, bot_id: str, parameters_to_update: dict) -> bool`**: Placeholder method for `LearningBot` to securely propose parameter updates for other bots.
    *   **`learn_gestural_syntax_from_sequence(self, interpreted_sequence: Any, user_feedback_or_outcome: dict) -> None`**: Placeholder method for `LearningBot` to learn from gestural sequences and their outcomes, supporting the "Gestural OS" concept.
    *   Commented-out placeholder for `propose_bot_logic_modification`: Acknowledges the very advanced "Liquid Code" concept where `LearningBot` might propose changes to bot logic via embeddings.
*   **`backend/tria_bots/GestureBot.py`**:
    *   Added a significant comment within the `process_gestures` method indicating that its output structure is expected to evolve towards a richer format (e.g., `InterpretedGestureSequence`) to support the "Gestural Holographic Operating System" concept.

These scaffolding elements are designed to be non-disruptive to current functionality while providing clear markers and foundational structures for the discussed visionary concepts.
