# Restoration Plan for Holographic Media Project

This directory contains a detailed analysis and restoration plan for key features of the Holographic Media project. The plan is based on historical code versions, development logs, and the current target architecture.

The goal is to document the best historical implementations of features and provide a clear path for their integration into the evolving codebase.

Each numbered markdown file addresses a specific feature area:
-   `1_timeline_and_versions.md`: Timeline of versions, prompt display, and LLM selection.
-   `2_chat_and_panels.md`: Chat functionality and right sidebar panel management.
-   `3_hologram_layout_and_interaction.md`: Hologram positioning, adaptive scaling, and interaction response.
-   `4_gesture_interface_and_visualization.md`: Gesture recording window and hand/finger tracking visualization.
-   `5_deferred_features.md`: Documentation of valuable features that were discussed but postponed.
