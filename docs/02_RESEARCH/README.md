# Research & Development - Future Technologies

This directory is dedicated to exploring cutting-edge technologies that could
significantly enhance the "Holographic Media" project in the long term, as
outlined in the "Future Directions" section of `../01_ARCHITECTURE/SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md`.

The research areas include:

-   **/neuro**: Investigating the integration of neurointerfaces (EEG, BCI) for direct neural interaction with holograms and Tria. This includes signal processing techniques and SDK integrations.
-   **/neuromorphic**: Exploring the use of neuromorphic computing hardware and Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) for ultra-low power, efficient AI processing, particularly for Tria's sensory systems or core logic.
-   **/quantum**: Researching the application of quantum algorithms and quantum machine learning (QML) for computationally intensive tasks such as searching vast holographic data stores or optimizing complex AI models within Tria.

## Approach
-   **Stay Informed:** Continuously monitor advancements in these fields.
-   **Proof-of-Concepts:** Develop small-scale simulations and stubs to understand the potential and challenges of each technology.
-   **Identify Integration Points:** Determine where these future technologies could provide the most impact within the Holographic Media architecture.
-   **Collaboration:** Seek collaborations with academic or industry research groups where appropriate.

The work in this directory is experimental and forward-looking, aiming to prepare the project for future technological breakthroughs.
