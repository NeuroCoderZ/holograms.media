# Neurointerface Integration Research

This directory contains research notes, proof-of-concept code, and documentation
related to integrating neurointerfaces (EEG, BCI) with the Holographic Media platform.
The long-term goal is to enable direct neural control and interaction with holograms.

## TODO
- Research available consumer and research-grade neurointerface devices.
- Explore SDKs and APIs for accessing neural data (e.g., Emotiv, OpenBCI).
- Develop proof-of-concept for basic command recognition from EEG signals.
- Investigate methods for translating neural patterns into holographic interactions.
