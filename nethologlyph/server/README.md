# NetHoloGlyph Server Implementation

This directory contains the server-side logic for the NetHoloGlyph protocol.
It might be implemented in Python (FastAPI/WebSockets), Rust, or C++ for performance.

## TODO
- Choose and implement network transport (WebSockets, WebRTC DataChannels, or raw UDP/TCP if applicable).
- Integrate with protocol definitions and serialization logic.
- Handle client connections, message routing, and state synchronization.
- Connect with backend services (e.g., Tria bots, database).
