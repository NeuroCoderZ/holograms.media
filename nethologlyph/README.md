# NetHoloGlyph Protocol

NetHoloGlyph is a custom network protocol designed for the "Holographic Media" project.
Its primary purpose is to facilitate real-time, efficient exchange of:
-   Holographic symbols and their updates.
-   Multimodal interaction data (gestures, voice commands).
-   Tria AI state information and commands.
-   Synchronization data for shared holographic experiences.

## Structure

-   **/protocol**: Contains the formal definitions of the protocol, including data structures and message formats (e.g., using Protocol Buffers or another Interface Definition Language - IDL). Also includes serialization/deserialization helper modules.
-   **/server**: Implementation of the NetHoloGlyph server. This might be a Python/FastAPI application using WebSockets, or a more performant solution in Rust/C++ if needed.
-   **/client**: A client-side JavaScript library for web applications to connect to the NetHoloGlyph server and communicate using the protocol.

## Key Design Goals

-   **Low Latency:** Crucial for interactive holographic experiences.
-   **Efficiency:** Minimize data overhead, especially for complex holographic data.
-   **Extensibility:** Allow for new message types and features as the project evolves.
-   **Scalability:** The server implementation should be able to handle a growing number of concurrent users and data streams.

## TODO
- Finalize the choice of IDL for protocol definitions (e.g., Protobuf, FlatBuffers).
- Fully define all core message types.
- Implement robust server-side logic for message handling, routing, and state synchronization.
- Develop a comprehensive client library with an easy-to-use API.
- Add security measures (authentication, authorization, encryption).
- Conduct performance testing and optimization.
