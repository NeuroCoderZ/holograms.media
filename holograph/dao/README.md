# HoloGraph DAO Governance

This directory contains documents and placeholder modules related to the
governance structure and processes of the HoloGraph Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO).

## TODO
- Define the DAO's constitution and operational guidelines.
- Design the proposal submission and voting mechanism.
- Specify roles and responsibilities within the DAO (e.g., council, moderators).
- Plan integration with tools like Snapshot.org for off-chain voting or develop on-chain voting contracts.
