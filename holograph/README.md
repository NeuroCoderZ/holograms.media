# HoloGraph Decentralized Economy

HoloGraph is the decentralized economic layer of the "Holographic Media" project.
It aims to create a self-sustaining ecosystem that rewards contributions,
incentivizes participation, and enables community-driven governance through the
HoloGraph Token (HGT) and a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO).

## Structure

-   **/contracts**: Contains the source code for smart contracts that form the backbone of the HoloGraph economy. This includes the HGT token contract, DAO governance contracts, vault/treasury management, and contracts for distributing rewards from "intellectual mining."
-   **/tokenomics**: Documentation detailing the economic model of HGT, including its utility, supply, allocation, distribution, and vesting schedules. This section will form a core part of the project's whitepaper.
-   **/dao**: Information and modules related to the HoloGraph DAO, including governance rules, proposal mechanisms, and voting procedures.
-   **/intellectual_mining**: Explores the concepts and mechanisms for "intellectual mining." This involves rewarding users with HGT for valuable contributions such as high-quality interaction data (chunks for Tria's training), computational resources, or development of new platform components.

## Key Components

-   **HoloGraph Token (HGT):** The native ERC20 (or equivalent) utility and governance token.
-   **DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization):** HGT holders govern the platform's development, treasury, and key parameters.
-   **Intellectual Mining:** A system to reward users for contributions that add value to the ecosystem (data, resources, code).
-   **DAO Vault:** A smart contract managing the DAO's treasury, funding development and initiatives based on proposals.

## Vision
To create a fair, transparent, and sustainable economic model that aligns the incentives of users, developers, and the platform itself, fostering growth and innovation within the Holographic Media ecosystem.

## TODO
- Finalize the choice of blockchain and smart contract language.
- Fully develop and audit all core smart contracts.
- Complete the detailed tokenomics whitepaper.
- Implement and deploy DAO governance tools.
- Build out the infrastructure for verifying and rewarding intellectual mining contributions.
