# Interaction Chunk Valuation for Intellectual Mining

Valuing "interaction chunks" (audio-video-gestural data) is crucial for fairly rewarding users
who contribute to Tria's learning and the richness of the Holographic Media platform.

## Key Principles
- **Quality over Quantity:** Chunks that are clear, unambiguous, and rich in information are more valuable.
- **Utility for Tria's Learning:** Chunks that help Tria learn new concepts, refine existing ones, or improve its understanding of multimodal communication are highly valued.
- **Novelty and Diversity:** Chunks representing new gestures, sounds, or scenarios can be more valuable than redundant data.
- **User Feedback:** Explicit user feedback (e.g., confirming Tria's interpretation, rating the interaction) can significantly increase a chunk's value.
- **Contextual Relevance:** The context in which a chunk is generated can influence its value.

## Potential Valuation Parameters

1.  **Clarity Score (Automated/Semi-Automated):**
    *   **Gesture Clarity:** Assessed by GestureBot (e.g., confidence score of classification, stability of tracking).
    *   **Audio Clarity:** Signal-to-noise ratio, clarity of speech (if applicable).
    *   **Video Clarity:** Lighting conditions, visibility of the user/environment.

2.  **Novelty Score (Automated, requires MemoryBot):**
    *   How different is this chunk from previously stored chunks? (e.g., based on embedding similarity).
    *   Does it represent a new gesture, a new word, or a new combination?

3.  **Information Content / Richness (Automated/Semi-Automated):**
    *   Number of distinct modalities present and synchronized.
    *   Complexity of the gesture or utterance.
    *   Presence of specific, sought-after patterns (e.g., for RSL research).

4.  **Tria's Learning Impact (Assessed by LearningBot over time):**
    *   Did this chunk (or similar ones) lead to a demonstrable improvement in Tria's performance on related tasks?
    *   Did it help resolve an ambiguity or correct a previous misinterpretation?
    *   This might be a retroactive bonus.

5.  **Explicit User Validation/Feedback Score:**
    *   User confirms Tria's interpretation of the chunk: High value.
    *   User corrects Tria's interpretation: Medium to high value (provides corrective data).
    *   User rates the interaction positively: Adds value.

6.  **Community Curation/Validation (Future):**
    *   A system where community members can review and rate chunks for quality and relevance.

## Reward Calculation (Conceptual)
`Reward_HGT = Base_Reward * Clarity_Multiplier * Novelty_Multiplier * Feedback_Bonus * Context_Factor`

- Parameters and multipliers would be governed by the DAO.
- Smart contracts (`IntellectualMiningRewards.sol`) would handle the distribution based on validated scores from an oracle system.

## TODO
- Develop algorithms for each scoring parameter.
- Design the oracle system for securely relaying these scores to the smart contract.
- Simulate the economic impact of different reward formulas.
