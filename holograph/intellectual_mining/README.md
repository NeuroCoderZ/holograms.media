# Intellectual Mining

This directory explores concepts and mechanisms for "intellectual mining" -
rewarding users for valuable contributions to the Holographic Media ecosystem,
such as providing high-quality data, computational resources, or developing Tria bots.

## TODO
- Define clear metrics for valuing different types of contributions.
- Design a decentralized validation system for contributions.
- Specify how rewards (HGT) are calculated and distributed.
