# HoloGraph Smart Contracts

This directory contains Solidity (or other smart contract language) source code
for the HoloGraph decentralized economy.

## TODO
- Finalize choice of blockchain platform (e.g., Ethereum L2, Polygon, etc.).
- Develop and test the HoloGraphToken (HGT) contract.
- Implement DAO governance contracts (voting, proposals).
- Design and implement smart contracts for intellectual mining rewards.
- Ensure contracts are audited and secure.
