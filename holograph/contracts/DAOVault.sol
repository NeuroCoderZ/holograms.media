// File: holograph/contracts/DAOVault.sol
// Purpose: Smart contract for managing the HoloGraph DAO's treasury and funds.
// Key Future Dependencies: HoloGraphToken.sol, DAO governance contracts.
// Main Future Exports/API: Functions for depositing, withdrawing (under DAO control), and fund allocation.
// Link to Legacy Logic (if applicable): N/A.
// Intended Technology Stack: Solidity.
// TODO: Implement functions for secure fund management.
// TODO: Integrate with proposal execution logic from DAO governance contracts.
// TODO: Add event logging for all transactions.
