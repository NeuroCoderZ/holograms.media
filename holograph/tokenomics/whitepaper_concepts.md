# HoloGraph Token (HGT) - Whitepaper Concepts (Draft)

## 1. Introduction
The HoloGraph Token (HGT) is the native utility and governance token of the Holographic Media ecosystem.
It is designed to incentivize participation, reward contributions, and facilitate decentralized governance.

## 2. HGT Utility
- **Governance:** HGT holders can participate in DAO decisions regarding platform development, feature prioritization, and treasury management.
- **Staking:** Staking HGT may be required for certain roles (e.g., validators, oracle providers) or provide rewards.
- **Payments:** HGT can be used for accessing premium features, services, or content within the ecosystem.
- **Rewards:** HGT is used to reward users for "intellectual mining" - providing valuable data (interaction chunks), computational resources, or developing new Tria bots/modules.

## 3. Token Supply & Allocation
- **Total Supply:** (e.g., 1,000,000,000 HGT) - To be finalized.
- **Distribution:**
    - Ecosystem Fund / DAO Treasury: (e.g., 40%) - For grants, development, rewards.
    - Team & Advisors: (e.g., 20%) - Subject to vesting.
    - Community / Public Sale: (e.g., 20%) - Details TBD.
    - Liquidity & Exchanges: (e.g., 10%).
    - Early Contributors & Seed: (e.g., 10%).
- **Vesting Schedules:** Will apply to team, advisor, and potentially seed investor tokens.

## 4. Intellectual Mining
- Users are rewarded with HGT for:
    - Submitting high-quality, validated interaction chunks that improve Tria's training.
    - Providing computational resources for distributed Tria training or NetHoloGlyph operations.
    - Developing and deploying useful Tria bots or modules approved by the DAO.
- Reward mechanisms will be managed by smart contracts and potentially validated by oracles or a decentralized validator network.

## 5. DAO and Treasury Management
- The HoloGraph DAO, controlled by HGT holders, will govern the ecosystem.
- The DAOVault contract will hold a significant portion of HGT, to be allocated based on DAO proposals for funding development, research, community initiatives, and operational costs.

## TODO
- Define specific metrics for "high-quality" interaction chunks.
- Detail the staking mechanism and rewards.
- Formalize the public sale or initial distribution strategy.
- Specify burn mechanisms or deflationary aspects, if any.
