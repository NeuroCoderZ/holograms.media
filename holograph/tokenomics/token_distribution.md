# HoloGraph Token (HGT) - Distribution and Vesting

This document provides a detailed overview of the HoloGraph Token (HGT) allocation strategy
and the vesting schedules applied to various stakeholders.

## Total Supply: [To Be Finalized, e.g., 1,000,000,000 HGT]

## Allocation Categories:

1.  **Ecosystem Fund / DAO Treasury:**
    *   **Percentage:** [e.g., 40%]
    *   **Purpose:** Long-term funding for project development, research grants, community initiatives, operational costs, and liquidity for intellectual mining rewards.
    *   **Vesting/Unlock:** Gradually unlocked over [e.g., 5-10 years] or as per DAO proposals. A portion may be available at TGE (Token Generation Event) for initial operations.

2.  **Founding Team & Future Team:**
    *   **Percentage:** [e.g., 20%]
    *   **Purpose:** To incentivize and reward the core team responsible for developing and launching the project.
    *   **Vesting/Unlock:** [e.g., 4-year vesting period with a 1-year cliff. Monthly or quarterly unlocks thereafter.]

3.  **Advisors:**
    *   **Percentage:** [e.g., 5%]
    *   **Purpose:** To compensate strategic advisors.
    *   **Vesting/Unlock:** [e.g., 2-year vesting period, possibly with a shorter cliff or milestone-based unlocks.]

4.  **Community & Public Distribution (Sale/Airdrops):**
    *   **Percentage:** [e.g., 20%]
    *   **Purpose:** To ensure broad distribution of HGT and raise funds if a public sale is conducted. May include airdrops to early adopters or community members.
    *   **Vesting/Unlock:** Details TBD. Tokens sold in public rounds may have different unlock schedules than airdropped tokens.

5.  **Liquidity & Exchange Listings:**
    *   **Percentage:** [e.g., 10%]
    *   **Purpose:** To provide initial liquidity on decentralized and centralized exchanges.
    *   **Vesting/Unlock:** Available at or shortly after TGE as needed for market making.

6.  **Early Contributors & Seed Round:**
    *   **Percentage:** [e.g., 5%]
    *   **Purpose:** To reward early supporters and seed investors.
    *   **Vesting/Unlock:** May have specific vesting schedules negotiated, potentially shorter than team tokens but longer than public sale tokens.
