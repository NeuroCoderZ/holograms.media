# Database Interaction Layer

This directory contains modules for connecting to the database (PostgreSQL with pgvector)
and performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

## TODO
- Implement robust connection pooling for PostgreSQL.
- Develop generic CRUD utilities and specific data access objects (DAOs).
- Integrate pgvector for similarity searches.
