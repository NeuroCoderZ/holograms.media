# File: backend/tria_bots/task_solver.py
# Purpose: Defines how Tria attempts to solve tasks generated by TaskGenerator within AZR.
# Key Future Dependencies: LearningBot, other Tria bots (GestureBot, AudioBot for execution).
# Main Future Exports/API: TaskSolver class with solve_task(task_definition).
# Link to Legacy Logic (if applicable): Part of AZR as mentioned in ROADMAP.md.
# Intended Technology Stack: Python.
# TODO: Implement strategies for Tria to attempt solving generated tasks (e.g., trial and error, model-based planning).
# TODO: Coordinate with other bots to execute actions related to the task.
# TODO: Record the outcome/attempt for evaluation by LearningBot.

    def __init__(self, gesture_bot, audio_bot): # Add other bots as needed
        self.gesture_bot = gesture_bot

        pass

        # if task_definition.get("type") == "communication_challenge":
        #     # E.g., try a new gesture sequence via GestureBot
        #     # solution_attempt["actions_taken"] = await self.gesture_bot.try_new_sequence(...)
        #     pass
