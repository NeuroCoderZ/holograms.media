# Tria AI Bots Network

This directory houses the intelligent core of the "Holographic Media" project: the Tria AI bots. Each bot is specialized for a particular function, and they work in concert under the `CoordinationService` to analyze multimodal inputs, learn from interactions, and generate meaningful holographic responses.

## Core Bots

-   **`GestureBot.py`**: Analyzes gestural input from users (e.g., via MediaPipe).
-   **`AudioBot.py`**: Processes audio input (voice commands, ambient sound) and can synthesize audio responses.
-   **`VideoBot.py`**: Provides deeper analysis of video context accompanying user interactions.
-   **`MemoryBot.py`**: Manages Tria's long-term memory, knowledge graph, and learned patterns using RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) with a PostgreSQL+pgvector backend.
-   **`LearningBot.py`**: Drives Tria's self-improvement and adaptation. This includes learning from user feedback and implementing principles of Absolute Zero Reasoning (AZR) for self-generated tasks.
-   **`CoordinationService.py`**: Acts as the orchestrator, routing information between bots, external services, and the main application API. It makes decisions on how to respond to user inputs.

## Absolute Zero Reasoning (AZR) Components

-   **`task_generator.py`**: Responsible for creating new tasks or challenges for Tria to solve, pushing its learning boundaries.
-   **`task_solver.py`**: Contains the logic for Tria to attempt the tasks generated by the `TaskGenerator`.

## Philosophy

The Tria bot network is designed around the idea that "Tria will assemble herself." Through continuous interaction, feedback, and self-driven learning (AZR), the bots are intended to evolve and improve their capabilities over time.

## TODO
- Fully implement the core logic for each bot.
- Develop robust communication protocols between bots via the `CoordinationService`.
- Implement the RAG mechanism in `MemoryBot` with `pgvector`.
- Design and build out the AZR task generation and solving loop.
- Integrate user feedback mechanisms to guide `LearningBot`.
