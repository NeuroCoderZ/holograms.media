# File: backend/tria_bots/task_generator.py
# Purpose: Defines how Tria generates tasks for itself within the Absolute Zero Reasoning (AZR) framework.
# Key Future Dependencies: LearningBot, MemoryBot (for inspiration/context).
# Main Future Exports/API: TaskGenerator class with generate_task().
# Link to Legacy Logic (if applicable): Part of AZR as mentioned in ROADMAP.md.
# Intended Technology Stack: Python.
# TODO: Define structure of a "task" (e.g., goal, constraints, evaluation criteria).
# TODO: Implement strategies for generating diverse and meaningful tasks (e.g., based on uncertainty, curiosity, or gaps in knowledge).
# TODO: Ensure tasks are solvable and contribute to Tria's learning objectives.
