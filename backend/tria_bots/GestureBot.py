# File: backend/tria_bots/GestureBot.py
# Purpose: Analyzes landmark_data and video_chunk to classify gestures and extract parameters.
# Key Future Dependencies: MediaPipe (or similar), numpy, services for context/memory.
# Main Future Exports/API: GestureBot class with methods like process_gestures(chunk_data).
# Link to Legacy Logic (if applicable): Relates to concepts in ARCHITECTURE.md for gesture analysis.
# Intended Technology Stack: Python, potentially ML/DL frameworks like TensorFlow/PyTorch.
# TODO: Implement detailed gesture classification logic (e.g., wave, pinch, point).
# TODO: Extract gesture parameters (speed, amplitude, direction).
# TODO: Generate gesture_embedding for MemoryBot.
# TODO: Integrate with video_chunk analysis for better context.

            # perhaps as a Pydantic model in backend/models/gesture_models.py in the future).
