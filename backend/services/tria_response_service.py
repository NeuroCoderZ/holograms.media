# File: backend/services/tria_response_service.py
# Purpose: Service for orchestrating Tria's response to commands or events.
# Key Future Dependencies: backend/tria_bots/CoordinationService.py, backend/models/tria_state_model.py.
# Main Future Exports/API: get_tria_response function.
# Link to Legacy Logic (if applicable): N/A
# Intended Technology Stack: Python.
# TODO: Implement logic to route commands to Tria's CoordinationService.
# TODO: Format Tria's output into a standardized response model.
# TODO: Handle different types of Tria interactions (e.g., direct command, asynchronous update).

# from ..models.tria_state_model import TriaCommand, TriaResponse
# from ..tria_bots.coordination_service import TriaCoordinationService # Assuming CoordinationService class
#
# async def get_tria_response_for_command(command: TriaCommand) -> TriaResponse:
#     # coordinator = TriaCoordinationService()
#     # tria_output = await coordinator.handle_command(command)
#     # response = TriaResponse(...) # format output
#     # return response
#     pass
