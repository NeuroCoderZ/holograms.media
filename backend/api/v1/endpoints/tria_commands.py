# File: backend/api/v1/endpoints/tria_commands.py
# Purpose: API endpoints for sending commands to Tria and receiving responses.
# Key Future Dependencies: FastAPI, Pydantic models from backend/models/, Tria coordination service.
# Main Future Exports/API: FastAPI router for /tria.
# Link to Legacy Logic (if applicable): N/A
# Intended Technology Stack: Python, FastAPI.
# TODO: Implement POST endpoint to send commands/queries to Tria.
# TODO: Implement GET endpoint or WebSockets for Tria's responses/updates.
# TODO: Define request and response models.
