# Main dependency for database interaction, consistent with backend/requirements.txt
asyncpg>=0.29.0

# functions-framework is provided by the Google Cloud Functions environment
# Other dependencies from backend/core are assumed to be deployed alongside the function
# or covered by the main backend/requirements.txt if the entire backend is deployed.
# Adding any other direct, function-specific dependencies here.
# For example, if this function used a unique image processing library:
# Pillow==<version>
# google-cloud-vision==<version>
# For now, only asyncpg is explicitly listed as critical for DB ops.
